Some of code is still to be considered alpha state code!

A lot of changes has been made since version 0.2.*!

Only methods documented in the online documentation should 
be considered stable (or beta). Please read the phpdoc above 
each method...

-------------------------------------------------------------

v0.10.x is actually a merge of v0.3.3 and v0.9.4.

The 'Net_NNTP' class in v0.9.x ha been renamed into 
'Net_NNTP_Realtime' (Net_NNTP_cached is still to come) so that 
both versions can exist together. The v0.3.x 'Net_NNTP' class is 
only provided so that backward compatibility is not broken, and 
it should not be used in new projects.

-------------------------------------------------------------

ATTENTION!!!

Both the Net_NNTP ant the Net_NNTP_Protocol classes should be 
considered beta quality code, but aside from the experimental 
methods etc. they should be stable enough to be considered close 
to stable.

The Net_NNTP_Realtime is still to be considered alpha state code, 
since it relies on the new header and message class. It uses the 
same Protocol class as the Net_NNTP class, so the basics is just
at stable. The real reason for the alpha state is the alpha state
of the header and message classes - their API might still change 
a little...

Those of you, who choose to use Net_NNTP_Realtime, please read 
the phpdoc above each function! And those of you who choose to 
use Net_NNTP in new projects, be aware that this class is 
officially dead - it's only provided for backward compatibility
with older v0.2 based projects... 

-------------------------------------------------------------

The actual intaraction with the server has been moved into 
a separate class named Net_NNTP_Protocol, where the commands 
each is accessed by a function; the list command is 
implemented in cmdList() etc. The Net_NNTP class extends 
Net_NNTP_Protocol, and the old methods no longer interacts 
directly with the server, but calls the inherited functions 
from Net_NNTP_Protocol.

One major diffrence form the previous versions of Net_NNTP is, 
that the code handles the returned data diffrently, so should 
now be binary safe, since each revieved line is no longer trimed.

The functions getArticle(), getHeaders() and getBody() have been 
'renamed' into getArticleRaw(), getHeaderRaw() and getBodyRaw().
These new methods have a second boolean parameter, which comes 
in handy, if one prefer the returned data in the original array, 
and thus prevent the array from being imploded into a string.

The authentication is now only performed once, when the 
connection is etablished, or when authenticate() is called - it 
is no longer handled in command().

Functions like min() and max() have been renamed to a make the
package more NNTP'ish (for those who know the RFCs).

The handling of errors in Net_NNTP_Protocol is much more 
extensive than in previous versions of Net_NNTP. Each cmdXXX() 
function handles the expected response codes, and only the 
response code og true is returned on success (previous versions 
returned the full status response string). On failure when 
interacting with the server the cmdXXX() functions returns 
pear_error objects.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Net_NNTP_Realtime only:

The method getArticle() has been replaced, and now returns a 
message object, and both getHeaders() and getBody() is gone...
